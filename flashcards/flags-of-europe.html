<h2>Useful notes</h2>

<p>Be aware of Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ and Latvia ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡», their flags are very similar. The key difference is the red on the Latvian flag is darker, and the white horizontal strip is narrower.</p>

<p>Similarly, the flags of Luxembourg ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º and the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± are very similar too. The most obvious difference here is that Luxembourg uses a noticeably brigter blue, as well as a slightly brighter red.

  <p>The flags of Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± and Monaco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨ are virtually the same, but flipped vertically. </p>

<p>A helpful way to remember the flag of Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ is to visualise a field of wheat (yellow), under a blue sky.</p>

<p>The flags of Russia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º, Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡° and Slovenia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡® are all horizontal tricolour flags, with bands of white, blue and red. Slovakia and Slovenia's flags each have a coat of arms on them. A a double white cross for Slovakia and a white Mount Triglav for Slovenia.</p>

<p>Romania ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ and Moldova ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡© are neighbouring countries with a very close relationship. Their flags are very similar in that they are both vertical tricolours of blue, yellow and red, the only difference being the Moldovan flag features the coat of arms (an eagle holding a shield on which there is a picture of an aurochs, an extinct type of cattle).</p>

<p>
  Hungary ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º and Bulgaria ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ also have similar flags. You might find it helpful to think of the Italian flag , which also shares the same colours ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹. The word "Italy" is similar in terms of syllables (and ending in -y) to Hungary, and this can help you to remember that Hungary's flag has a white band in the middle just like Italy's does.
