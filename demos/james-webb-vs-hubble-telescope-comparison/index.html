<p>On 12th July 2022, several images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) were released to the public for the first time. Above is the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. What you see is a very tiny patch of sky about the equivalent in size to the area a grain of sand takes up when holding it at arm's length.</p>

<p>The tool allows you to pan and zoom around the image, in addition to toggling an equivalent photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
