			UNESCO have estimated that there are over 3 million shipwrecks lying on ocean floors around the world, some of which may be thousands of years old. They are important for a number of different reasons. <em>Historic wrecks</em> can provide archaeologists with snapshots of what the world was like when the ship sunk; <em>Military wrecks</em> can provide historians with details about historical battles; <em>Contemporary wrecks</em> need to be closely observed in order to determine the reasons the wreck occurred and the environmental impact the wreck may have on its surroundings. Wrecks that lie near the surface of the water, or are only partially submerged can be seen with satellite imagery of the earth.

		<h3>World Discoverer</h3>

		<p>
			In April 2000, the cruise ship World Discoverer was sailing down the Sandfly Passage, Solomon Islands, when it struck an uncharted object and began taking on water. All passengers and crew were rescued before the Captain grounded the ship in Roderick Bay where it has remained ever since.

		</p>

		<h3>MV Captayannis</h3>

		<p>
			On 27 January 1974, the sugar carrying MV Captayannis began taking on water after colliding with a BP tanker in the River Clyde, Scotland, during a storm. The captain piloted her to a sandbank to prevent sinking where she heeled over. All crew were safely rescued.
		</p>

		<h3>Chernobyl Harbour</h3>

		<p>
			Chernobly Harbour is home to a large number of rusting and sinking ships which were abandoned in the aftermath of the nuclear disaster which took place there in 1986.
		</p>

		<h3>MV Plassy</h3>

		<p>
			MV Plassy was a stream trawler that ran onto Finnis Rock, Aran Islands, in March 1960 during a severe storm. All crew were safely rescued.

The quake resulted in a devestating Tsunami which claimed over 15,000 lives and caused an estimated $235 billion USD of damage.</p>

		<p>The true force of the Tsunami can be demonstrated by the wreck of the fishing trawler Kyotoku-maru no.18, which was swept more than half a kilometer from the harbour. Plans to keep the vessel in place as a monument were overturned in 2013 and the ship has since been scrapped and is no longer visible.</p>
