	Over the course of millions of years, the human eye has evolved to detect light in the range 380&mdash;780nm,
	a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum known as <em>visible light</em>, which we perceive as colour.
	The particular range of wavelengths coincides with a window in the Earth's atmosphere, through which this light can travel. Higher frequency radiation, such as x-rays are absorbed by the atmosphere, as are lower frequencies, such as microwaves.
</p>

<p>
	Sunlight appears white to us because it emits almost uniformly over all visible frequencies. However, a laser for example, emits only at a single very specific frequency. Helium-neon lasers emit at 632.8nm, which is a bright red. The lasers in your Blu-ray player emit at 405nm, which as the name suggests, is blue. We can begin to build up a picture of how frequency is related to colour.
</p>

<p>
	A frequent way of referring to colour on computer screens is by using the RGB system. In this model, each colour is given a value for each red, green and blues components ranging from 0 to 255, giving a total value of 16.7 million possible colours. However, due to the very complex way in which the eye perceives colours,
	we can see colours which are outside of the <em>gamut</em> of the RGB scheme - there is no unique mapping that definitively converts a wavelength to a colour, and as such
	the above tool should been seen as more of an approximation than a rigorous resource.
